        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the project directory (if not, create one using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the necessary libraries). Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure `requirements.txt` includes at least `streamlit`, `pandas`, and `openpyxl`)*

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    Make sure your virtual environment is activated. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    # IMPORTANT: Replace 'your_app_script.py' with the actual name of your Python script
    # (e.g., vitasana_simulator.py or app.py)
    streamlit run your_app_script.py
    ```

2.  **Access the App:**
    Streamlit will automatically open the application in your default web browser. If not, the terminal will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8500`) that you can open manually.

3.  **Interact:**
    Use the sidebar to input your business parameters (costs, price, goals, etc.). The main panel will update automatically with calculations, projections, charts, and the scenario comparison tool.
